# Data-Analyst-Task-5

Hi, I have completed the task 5 of EDA. The following summarization of EDA on dataset as follows.

Data Overview:
I have taken dataset from given link in kaggle.
891 rows, 12 columns
Mixed data types: numerical and categorical
I have histograms and boxplots to see the distribution of key numerical features!

Observations: 
Age: Likely to see a normal-ish distribution, with many people in 20â€“40 range.
Fare: Skewed to the right, some very high outliers (first class, rich passengers).
Women had higher survival rates (priority in rescue).
